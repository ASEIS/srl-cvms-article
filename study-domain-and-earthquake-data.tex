\section{Study domain and earthquake data}

Considered events for this study, containing thirty moderate-magnitude earthquakes ($3.5 > M_w > 5.5$) occurred between 1998 and 2014, are spread throughout a simulation domain with a volume projection of \vdomain{180}{135}{62}{km}, which covers the entire Los Angeles metropolitan area and most of the significant geologic structures around. (Fig.~\ref{fig:region}) shows the simlation domain in which we labled the events with sequential letter code from A to Z and AA to AD and Table \ref{tab:events} provides detailed information for those selected events.The unprocessed recorded data from Southern California Earthquake Data Center (SCEDC) and Center for Engineering Strong Motion Data (CESMD) are downloaded for each of the earthquakes to take advantage of the numerous time series available from different data centers. We obtained records for moree than 800 stations, Some of which were in common between different networks and some were not usable. Records from SDEDC and CESMD were processed and selected for each event. we performed gain and baseline corrections, and applied a \textcolor{red}{high-pass filter at 0.05 Hz} before integrating to obtain velocities and displacements. The final number of chosen records for validation for any of the selected earthquake can be found in Table \ref{tab:events}. For almost all of the events there is enough available stations to make the results of validation acceptable.
