\section{Introduction}

Developing community velocity models, or CVMs, that can be broadly applied and continuously updated by a community of users has became the point of interest in simulation-based hazard analysis. CVM-S (\citet{Magistrale_2000_BSSA} and \citet{Kohler_2003_BSSA}), and CVM-H (SÃ¼ss and Shaw, 2003) models, released by Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC), are good examples of community models, evolved over time with contributions from researchers who studied ground motion characteristics in southern California. CVM-S, also known as CVM-S4, was originally developed by \citet{Magistrale_1996_BSSA} and later updated by \citet{Magistrale_2000_BSSA} and \citet{Kohler_2003_BSSA}. Recently, a new version of CVM-S, called CVM-S4.26 was built based on the original model and the results of a sequence of 3D full-waveform tomographic inversions done by \citet{Chen_2007_BSSA} and \citet{Lee_2014_JGR}. CVM-S is known as an acceptable representations of the crustal structure in southern California, at low frequencies ($f \leq 0.2$~Hz) and also according to our recent paper under review, (Taborda et al., 2016), even till the frequecny of 1 Hz, it is getting better results than the alternative model CVM-H for the region understudy. Those results are in good agreement with previous works done in the area for particular cases (e.g. \citet{Taborda_2014_BSSA}and \citet{Lee_2014_SRL}). There are currently three alternative CVM-SI.26 models (2.2.1, 2.2.2 \& 2.2.3) available which vary depending on how the perturbations were applied to the original model. There have been some researches with the aim of evaluation of different velocity models for southern California region in lower frequencies or for limited number of events. Such differences, however, have never been studied extensively for multiple events and/or at frequencies beyond the upper limits set by the underlying inversions used to construct the models.\par

Here, we designed a systematic procedure, through quantitative comparisons among synthetics results of four versions of CVM-S and recorded data of thirty moderate-magnitude events, to evaluate the overall improvement of accuracy in predicting ground motion within simulation domain of \adomain{180}{135}{km}. The simulations are performed at frequency of 1Hz and minimum shear wave velocity of 200 m/s using Hercules, a finite element application for solving forward wave propagation problems due to kinematic faulting \citep{Tu_2006_Proc, Taborda_2010_Tech}, and comparisions are ranked quantitatively by means of a goodness-of-fit (GOF) criteria obtained following a modified version of the criteria introduced by \citet{Anderson_2004_Proc}. In the light of the comparision of the regional distribution of the GOF results for all events and all models, We conclude that CVM-SI26.2.2.3 consistently yields better results which shows that the improvements done to CVM-S have positive effects at frequencies above the limit considered for the inversions.
