  Abstract                 = {We simulate long-period ($T>1.0$--2.0 s) and broadband ($T>0.1$ s) ground motions for 39 scenario earthquakes (Mw 6.7-7.2) involving the Hayward, Calaveras, and Rodgers Creek faults. For rupture on the Hayward fault, we consider the effects of creep on coseismic slip using two different approaches, both of which reduce the ground motions, compared with neglecting the influence of creep. Nevertheless, the scenario earthquakes generate strong shaking throughout the San Francisco Bay area, with about 50 percent of the urban area experiencing modified Mercalli intensity VII or greater for the magnitude 7.0 scenario events. Long-period simulations of the 2007 Mw 4.18 Oakland earthquake and the 2007 Mw 5.45 Alum Rock earthquake show that the U.S. Geological Survey's Bay Area Velocity Model version 08.3.0 permits simulation of the amplitude and duration of shaking throughout the San Francisco Bay area for Hayward fault earthquakes, with the greatest accuracy in the Santa Clara Valley (San Jose area). The ground motions for the suite of scenarios exhibit a strong sensitivity to the rupture length (or magnitude), hypocenter (or rupture directivity), and slip distribution. The ground motions display a much weaker sensitivity to the rise time and rupture speed. Peak velocities, peak accelerations, and spectral accelerations from the synthetic broadband ground motions are, on average, slightly higher than the Next Generation Attenuation (NGA) ground-motion prediction equations. We attribute much of this difference to the seismic velocity structure in the San Francisco Bay area and how the NGA models account for basin amplification; the NGA relations may underpredict amplification in shallow sedimentary basins. The simulations also suggest that the Spudich and Chiou (2008) directivity corrections to the NGA relations could be improved by increasing the areal extent of rupture directivity with period.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper reports on the development of a parallel numerical methodology for simulating large-scale earthquake-induced ground motion in highly heterogeneous basins. We target large sedimentary basins with contrasts in wavelengths of over an order of magnitude. Regular grid methods prove intractable for such problems. We overcome the problem of multiple physical scales by using unstructured finite elements on locally-resolved Delaunay triangulations derived from octree-based grids. The extremely large mesh sizes require special mesh generation techniques. Despite the method's multiresolution capability, large problem sizes necessitate the use of distributed memory parallel supercomputers to solve the elastic wave propagation problem. We have developed a system that helps automate the task of writing efficient portable unstructured mesh solvers for distributed memory parallel supercomputers. The numerical methodology and software system have been used to simulate the seismic response of the San Fernando Valley in Southern California to an aftershock of the 1994 Northridge Earthquake. We report on parallel performance on the Cray T3D for several models of the basin ranging in size from 35 000 to 77 million tetrahedra. The results indicate that, despite the highly irregular structure of the problem, excellent performance and scalability are achieved.},

  Abstract                 = {This report summarizes and documents empirical compressional wave velocity (Vp) versus depth relationships for several important rock types in northern California used in constructing the new USGS Bay Area Velocity Model 05.0.0 [http://www.sf06simulation.org/]. These rock types include the Jurassic and Cretaceous Franciscan Complex (metagraywacke and greenstones), serpentinites, Cretaceous Salinian and Sierra granites and granodiorites, Jurassic and Cretaceous Great Valley Sequence, and older Cenozoic sedimentary rocks (including the La Honda basin). Similar relations for less volumetrically important rocks are also developed for andesites, basalts, gabbros, and Sonoma Volcanics. For each rock type I summarize and plot the data used to develop the velocity versus depth relationships. These plots document the existing constraints on the proposed relationships. This report also presents a new empirical Vp versus depth relation derived from hundreds of measurements in USGS 30-m vertical seismic profiles (VSPs) for Holocene and Plio-Quaternary deposits in the San Francisco Bay area. For the upper 40 m (0.04 km) these mainly Holocene deposits, can be approximated by Vp (km/s) = 0.7 + 42.968z - 575.8z2 + 2931.6z3 - 3977.6z4, where z is depth in km. In addition, this report provides tables summarizing these VSP observations for the various types of Holocene and Plio-Quaternary deposits. In USGS Bay Area Velocity Model 05.0.0 these compressional wave velocity (Vp) versus depth relationships are converted to shear wave velocity (Vs) versus depth relationships using recently proposed empirical Vs versus Vp relations. Density is calculated from Vp using Gardner's rule and relations for crystalline rocks proposed by Christensen and Mooney (1995). Vs is then used to calculate intrinsic attenuation coefficients for shear and compressional waves, Qs and Qp, respectively.},

  Abstract                 = {Three-dimensional simulations of earthquakes have given a deeper understanding of wave propagation and site effects in urban regions. In this work we study the impact of a potential major earthquake on the San Andreas Fault with significant seismic hazard in the Greater Los Angeles Basin. We present results for the ShakeOut simulation---a rupture beginning near Salton Sea, California, heading 270 km northwest along the fault, that produces a Mw 7.8 earthquake in a geographical region which includes all major populated areas of Southern California and northern Mexico, in a 600 km by 300 km by 80 km volume, for a maximum frequency of 1.0 Hz and a minimum shear wave velocity of 200 m/s. For the material model, we use a discretized version of SCEC's CVM4 velocity model, called CVM-Etree. The simulation was performed at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center using Hercules, a finite element octree-based, parallel software developed by the Quake Group at Carnegie Mellon University. Hercules implements a highly efficient end-to-end algorithm for solving the wave field in highly heterogeneous media due to kinematic faulting. We verify our results by comparing synthetic seismograms computed with a parallel finite difference code by Robert Graves (URS) for a similar scenario earthquake, for a maximum frequency of 0.5 Hz and minimum shear wave velocity of 500 m/s. We focus our analysis of the results of the 1.0 Hz ShakeOut simulation on the Los Angeles Basin area, and the Santa Clara River Valley and Oxnard Plain. We examine the site effects present in these two areas and their proneness to capture and amplify seismic waves due to their geological features. Results show a direct correlation between the amplification levels and the local soil and basin profiles.}

  Abstract                 = {This article documents a comparative exercise for numerical simulation of ground motion, addressing the seismic response of the Grenoble site, a typical Alpine valley with complex 3D geometry and large velocity contrasts. Predictions up to 2 Hz were asked for four different structure wave-field configurations (point source and extended source, with and without surface topography). This effort is part of a larger exercise organized for the third international symposium on the effects of surface geology (ESG 2006), the complete results of which are reported elsewhere (Tsuno et al., 2009). While initial, blind computations significantly differed from one another, a remarkable fit was obtained after correcting for some nonmethodological errors for four 3D methods: the arbitrary high-order derivative discontinuous Galerkin method (ADER-DGM), the velocity-stress finite-difference scheme on an arbitrary discontinuous staggered grid (FDM), and two implementations of the spectral-element method (SEM1 and SEM2). Their basic formulation is briefly recalled, and their implementation for the Grenoble Valley and the corresponding requirements in terms of computer resources are detailed. Besides a visual inspection of PGV maps, more refined, quantitative comparisons based on time-frequency analysis greatly help in understanding the origin of differences, with a special emphasis on phase misfit. The match is found excellent below 1 Hz, and gradually deteriorates for increasing frequency, reflecting differences in meshing strategy, numerical dispersion, and implementation of damping properties. While the numerical prediction of ground motion cannot yet be considered a mature, push-button approach, the good agreement reached by four participants indicates that, when used properly, numerical simulation is actually able to handle correctly wave radiation from extended sources in complex 3D media. The main recommendation to obtain reliable numerical predictions of earthquake ground motion is to use at least two different but comparably accurate methods, for instance the present formulations and implementations of the FDM, SEM, and ADER-DGM.},

  Abstract                 = {We apply full 3D tomography (f3dt) to a regional dataset in the Los Angeles area. In f3dt, the starting model as well as the model perturbation is three- dimensional and the sensitivity (Frechet) kernels are computed using numerical schemes that account for the full physics of 3D wave propagation. f3dt can account for the nonlinearity of structural inverse problem through iteration, thus providing the most efficient means for assimilating seismic observations into dynamic ground- motion models. We have successfully applied a scattering-integral (si) formulation of f3dt to improve a 3D elastic structure model, the Southern California Earthquake Center (scec) Community Velocity Model version 3.0 (CVM3.0) with lowest shear velocity clamped at 1 km/sec, in the Los Angeles region. Our data are time- and frequency-localized measurements of phase-delay anomalies relative to synthetics computed from the 3D elastic starting model. The Frechet kernels for our measurements were computed by convolving the earthquake wave fields generated by point earthquake sources with the receiver Green tensors (rgts), which are the spatial- temporal fields produced by three orthogonal unit impulsive point forces acting at the receiver locations. We inverted 7364 phase-delay measurements of P and S body waves by using the lsqr method. The revised 3D model, LAF3D, provides substantially better fit to the observed waveform data than the 3D starting model. To our knowledge, this study is the first successful application of f3dt using real data in structural seismology.},

  Abstract                 = {The 2001 Big Bear Lake earthquake (Mw 4.63) was recorded by over 30 strong-motion instruments in the San Bernardino basin region of southern California. At periods longer than about 1 sec, the ground motions in the central portion of the basin have significantly larger amplitudes and extended durations of strong shaking relative to sites outside the basin. In many cases, the peak motions at the basin sites occur 10 or more seconds after the direct S-wave arrival, suggesting that these arrivals are controlled by basin-generated surface waves. To model these motions, I have performed finite-difference simulations using a 3D representation of the basin velocity structure. The basin structure has a minimum shear velocity of 250 m/sec, which coupled with the model grid spacing of 50 m yields a bandwidth resolution limit of T>1 sec for the numerical simulations. The simulations do quite well at reproducing the observed waveforms, amplitudes, and durations at periods of 3 sec and longer. At shorter periods (12 sec), the fit to the recorded motions is less well resolved, especially in matching the waveforms of the later-arriving phases. This suggests that in regions of complex geology, deterministic waveform modeling at periods approaching 1 sec involves more than simply reducing the minimum velocity threshold and, in particular, requires knowledge of the subsurface structure and distribution of seismic velocities at relatively short length scales (on the order of 50 m).},

  Abstract                 = {This article provides an overview of the application of the staggered-grid finite-difference technique to model wave propagation problems in 3D elastic media. In addition to presenting generalized, discrete representations of the differential equations of motion using the staggered-grid approach, we also provide detailed formulations that describe the incorporation of moment-tensor sources, the implementation of a stable and accurate representation of a planar free-surface boundary for 3D models, and the derivation and implementation of an approximate technique to model spatially variable anelastic attenuation within time-domain finite-difference computations. The comparison of results obtained using the staggered-grid technique with those obtained using a frequency-wavenumber algorithm shows excellent agreement between the two methods for a variety of models. In addition, this article also introduces a memory optimization procedure that allows large-scale 3D finite-difference problems to be computed on a conventional, single-processor desktop workstation. With this technique, model storage is accommodated using both external (hard-disk) and internal (core) memory. To reduce system overhead, a cascaded time update procedure is utilized to maximize the number of computations performed between I/O operations. This formulation greatly expands the applicability of the 3D finite-difference technique by providing an efficient and practical algorithm for implementation on commonly available workstation platforms.},

Teleseismic P-wave arrival times are obtained from three temporary passive experiments and Southern California Seismic Network (SCSN) stations, producing good raypath coverage. The inversion is performed using a damped least-squares conjugate gradient method (LSQR). The inversion model element spacing is 20 km. Before the inversion, the effects of crustal velocity heterogeneities represented by the Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) seismic velocity model version 2 are removed from the teleseismic travel times. The P-wave inversion produces a variance reduction of 43 percent. S-wave velocities are determined from laboratory Vp/Vs ratios. The most prominent features imaged in the results are high P-wave velocities (+3 percent) in the uppermost mantle beneath the northern Los Angeles basin, and the previously reported tabular high-velocity anomaly (+3 percent) to depths of 200 km beneath the Transverse Ranges, crosscutting the San Andreas fault. We incorporate the upper mantle seismic velocity heterogeneities into the SCEC Southern California reference seismic velocity model. The prior accounting for the crustal velocity heterogeneity demonstrates the utility of the top-down method of the SCEC seismic velocity model development.},

  Abstract                 = {We present the spectral element method to simulate elastic-wave propagation in realistic geological structures involving complieated free-surface topography and material interfaces for two- and three-dimensional geometries. The spectral element method introduced here is a high-order variational method for the spatial approximation of elastic-wave equations. The mass matrix is diagonal by construction in this method, which drastically reduces the computational cost and allows an efficient parallel implementation. Absorbing boundary conditions are introduced in variational form to simulate unbounded physical domains. The time discretization is based on an energy-momentum conserving scheme that can be put into a classical explicit-implicit predictor/multi-corrector format. Long-term energy conservation and stability properties are illustrated as well as the efficiency of the absorbing conditions. The associated Courant condition behaves as {Delta}tC < O (nel-1/ndN-2), with nel the number of elements, nd the spatial dimension, and N the polynomial order. In practice, a spatial sampling of approximately 5 points per wavelength is found to be very accurate when working with a polynomial degree of N = 8. The accuracy of the method is shown by comparing the spectral element solution to analytical solutions of the classical two-dimensional (2D) problems of Lamb and Garvin. The flexibility of the method is then illustrated by studying more realistic 2D models involving realistic geometries and complex free-boundary conditions. Very accurate modeling of Rayleigh-wave propagation, surface diffraction, and Rayleigh-to-body-wave mode conversion associated with the free-surface curvature are obtained at low computational cost. The method is shown to provide an efficient tool to study the diffraction of elastic waves by three-dimensional (3D) surface topographies and the associated local effects on strong ground motion. Complex amplification patterns, both in space and time, are shown to occur even for a gentle hill topography. Extension to a heterogeneous hill structure is considered. The efficient implementation on parallel distributed memory architectures will allow to perform real-time visualization and interactive physical investigations of 3D amplification phenomena for seismic risk assessment.},

The aim of this study is to propose a 3D model of this sedimentary structure that can later be used to model the seismic records currently being obtained by the permanent accelerograph network operating in the area. This model builds on previous efforts and incorporates new data. The geometry and dynamic properties of the soil layers were inverted using data from microtremor array measurements, seismic refraction profiles, boreholes, and geotechnical investigations. Phase-velocity dispersion curves of Rayleigh waves were determined at 27 sites in the basin using the spatial autocorrelation method (SPAC) introduced by Aki. S-wave velocity profiles were inverted from these dispersion curves and the whole valley structure was interpolated using our new results and all previously available data. The proposed 3D model describes the geometry and shear-wave velocities of the Mygdonian and pre-Mygdonian sedimentary systems, and the top bedrock surface. Our results indicate that this 3D model correctly reflects the geometry and dynamic properties of the sedimentary layers. The case of Euroseistest, where the subsoil structure is the result of bringing together many disparate data, could be used as an example for similar alluvial basins throughout the world, where usually only scarce data is available.},

The model was developed using kriging techniques implemented in GoCAD (a commercial application specializing in the construction of surfaces, the analysis of spatially distributed data, and the modeling or simulation of properties) and is characterized by a heterogeneous, spatial varying velocity gradient with maximum velocities of ~5000 m/s in the sedimentary section. Variability of the observed P wave velocities increases with depth, reflecting complex structural and sedimentological controls. The model contains a new representation of the basin shape as defined by the sediment-basement interface, which was mapped using well control and seismic reflection profiles. Our model differs substantially in approach and outcome from previous representations of crustal velocity structure in southern California.},

  Abstract                 = {Large-scale earthquake simulation requires source datasets which describe the highly heterogeneous physical characteristics of the earth in the region under simulation. Physical characteristic datasets are the first stage in a simulation pipeline which includes mesh generation, partitioning, solving, and visualization. In practice, the data is produced in an ad-hoc fashion for each set of experiments, which has several significant shortcomings including lower performance, decreased repeatability and comparability, and a longer time to science, an increasingly important metric.

As a solution to these problems, we propose a new approach for providing scientific data to ground motion simulations, in which ground model datasets are fully materialized into octress stored on disk, which can be more efficiently queried (by up to two orders of magnitude) than the underlying community velocity model programs. While octrees have long been used to store spatial datasets, they have not yet been used at the scale we propose. We further propose that these datasets can be provided as a service, either over the Internet or, more likely, in a datacenter or supercomputing center in which the simulations take place. Since constructing these octrees is itself a challenge, we present three data-parallel techniques for efficiently building them, which can significantly decrease the build time from days or weeks to hours using commodity clusters. This approach typifies a broader shift toward science as a service techniques in which scientific computation and storage services become more tightly intertwined.},

  Abstract                 = {This study deals with the effects of the built environment on the earthquake ground motion, and with how individual buildings interact with the surrounding soil and with each other. We conduct a parametric study using Hercules, the parallel octree-based finite element earthquake simulator developed by the Quake Group at Carnegie Mellon University. Because of the necessity of performing repeated ground motion simulations , our analysis is based on the Domain Reduction Method (DRM), a modular two-step finite element methodology for modeling earthquake ground motion in highly heterogeneous localized regions. Buildings are included by modifying Hercules' finite-element meshing routines so that they are incorporated as additional block elements that are adjusted to emulate the general geometric and dynamic characteristics of buildings in city-like arrangements. We conduct our study in the greater Los Angeles basin using the main shock of 1994 Northridge earthquake for frequencies up to 2 Hz and a domain size of 85x85x42.5 km3 as the first step of the DRM. Then, we reduce the size of the region to a small subdomain of 2x2x1 km3 within the downtown Los Angeles region and introduce the building structures, for the second step of the DRM, in order to perform the repeated simulations of the parametric study.},

The model illuminates shallow features such as sedimentary basins and compositional contrasts across faults. It also reveals crustal features at depth that aid in the tectonic reconstruction of southern California, such as subduction-captured oceanic crustal fragments.

This function is derived from a source-time function first proposed by Yoffe (1951), which yields a traction evolution showing a slip-weakening behavior. In order to remove its singularity, we apply a convolution with a triangular function and obtain a regularized source-time function called the regularized Yoffe function. We propose a parameterization of this slip-velocity time function through the final slip, its duration, and the duration of the positive slip acceleration (Tacc). Using this analytical function, we examined the relation between kinematic parameters, such as peak slip velocity and slip duration, and dynamic parameters, such as slip-weakening distance and breakdown-stress drop. The obtained scaling relations are consistent with those proposed by Ohnaka and Yamashita (1989) from laboratory experiments. This shows that the proposed source-time function suitably represents dynamic rupture propagation with finite slip-weakening distances.},

The sorted records are indexed by a conventional file-resident B-tree index and queried using fixed-length locational code keys. A schema can be defined to make an etree portable across different platforms. The etree library provides functions for creating, modifying, and searching octrees, including efficient mechanisms for appending octants and iterating over octants in Z-order. The library is the foundation for a larger research effort aimed at enabling scientists and engineers to solve large physical simulations on their desktop systems by recasting the simulation process to work directly on large etrees stored on disk.},

  Abstract                 = {Parallel supercomputing has traditionally focused on the inner kernel of scientific simulations: the solver. The front and back ends of the simulation pipeline---problem description and interpretation of the output---have taken a back seat to the solver when it comes to attention paid to scalability and performance, and are often relegated to offline, sequential computation. As the largest simulations move beyond the realm of the terascale and into the petascale, this decomposition in tasks and platforms becomes increasingly untenable. We propose an end-to-end approach in which all simulation components---meshing, partitioning, solver, and visualization---are tightly coupled and execute in parallel with shared data structures and no intermediate I/O. We present our implementation of this new approach in the context of octree-based finite element simulation of earthquake ground motion. Performance evaluation on up to 2048 processors demonstrates the ability of the end-to-end approach to overcome the scalability bottlenecks of the traditional approach.},

  Abstract                 = {We describe a technique to derive first-order site-condition maps directly from topographic data. For calibration, we use global 30 arc sec topographic data and VS30 measurements (here VS30 refers to the average shear-velocity down to 30 m) aggregated from several studies in the United States, as well as in Taiwan, Italy, and Australia. VS30 values are correlated against topographic slope to develop two sets of parameters for deriving VS30: one for active tectonic regions where topographic relief is high, and one for stable shields where topography is more subdued. By taking the gradient of the topography and choosing ranges of slope that maximize the correlation with shallow shear-velocity observations, we can recover, to first order, many of the spatially varying features of site-condition maps developed for California. Our site-condition map for the low-relief Mississippi Embayment also predicts the bulk of the VS30 observations in that region despite rather low slope ranges.We find that maps derived from the slope of the topography are often well correlated with other independently derived, regional-scale site-condition maps, but the latter maps vary in quality and continuity, and subsequently, also in their ability to match observed VS30 measurements contained therein. Alternatively, the slope-based method provides a simple approach to uniform site-condition mapping.After validating this approach in regions with numerous VS30 observations, we subsequently estimate and map site conditions for the entire continental United States using the respective slope correlations.},
