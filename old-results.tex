\section{Results}

Here, We have the result of quantitative measures to assess the level of agreement between the data and the simulation, using different parameters, scores, and combinations proposed by Anderson (2004) with the modifications explained earlier. We begin by presenting the overall final result, and then break it down into some of its different components and combinations

Figure ... shows the distribution of S1 scores, averaged between the three components of motion for all the validation stations in the region of interest for any of the events.
