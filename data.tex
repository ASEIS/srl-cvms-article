\section{Data Processing}

The unprocessed recorded data of different networks from SCEC and Strong motion are downloaded for each of the events to take advantage of the numerous time series available from different data centers.

Some of the stations were in common between different networks and some of them were not usable and they needed to be removed. 
The total number of stations available from different networks and the final number of chosen records  for validation for any of the selected earthquake is presented in table 2.  
As it shows, only two events, Chino Hills and Lahabra, have a large number of recorded data. Still, for almost all of the events there is enough  available stations to make the results of validation acceptable.
