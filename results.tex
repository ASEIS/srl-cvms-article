\section{Results}

Here, We have the result of quantitative measures to assess the level of agreement between the data and the simulation, using the GOF scores, which is discussed in details in evaluation method section. We begin by presenting the overall final result, and then break it down into some of its different components and combinations. 

Fig.~\ref{fig:gof} presents GOF results of all four vesions of velocity models for some selected events with largest number of stations. The countour surface in these plots are built based on FS values computed at each section. Although the spacial interpolation for colored surface is artificial, it is facilitate understaing of results and it is consitant with previous similar works. Brighter colors corresponds to higher scores and consequently better matchs. Fig.~\ref{fig:gof} also includes histograms of the scores in interval of 0.5 points on the 0 to 10 scoring scale. Having histograms with a tendency toward right side of the scale indicates more stations with higher scores. We can see an overall improvement in this matter, while going from CVM-S4 to CVM-S4.26.223.

Since the models differ only in detailes, the scores corresponding to them would be close and the difference plots can better highlight the differences and would be more helpful to discuss the results. Fig.~\ref{fig:gof_diff} shows differece between the distribution of total scores for all the validation stations in the region of interest for any of the events for 3 versions of CVM-S4.26 with respect to CVMS-4. This figure illustrates the wide range of results indicating events and areas in which any of the velocity models have better results.
